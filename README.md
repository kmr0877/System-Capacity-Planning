# System-Capacity-Planning
This project is inspired by the research work reported in the article Optimal Power Allocation in Server Farms [1]. Server farms are a common part of many corporationsâ€™ computing infrastructure but they consume a lot of energy. The key question asked in this research is: Is it possible to reduce the energy consumption of server farms while maintaining good response time of the com- puting system.
